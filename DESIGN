Suffixes, in the order in which they are applied to the main algorithm name:

_xform          - performs a step with op(*first) instead of *first
_if, _if_not    - performs a step only if pred(*first) is true
_n              - counted instead of bounded range

Instead of returning pair<> or tuple<> from functions, we return tailor-made
structs (algorithm_name)_result, which has the advantage that the names of
the members can be chosen to match the contents, instead of always being the
generic 'first' and 'second' of std::pair<>.
